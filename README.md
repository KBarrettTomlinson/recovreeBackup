# RECOVREE APP
Recovree is a mobile first web application that aims to encourage journaling for recovering drug and alcohol addicts through the use of daily Reflections.  Reflections are essentially interactive journal entries completed through the use of a simple and easy to use yet engaging form that participants are reminded to complete daily.  Registering for the application allows participants to keep track of the emotional states they experience through daily, weekly, and monthly summary views that visualize the participantsâ€™ data through charts and graphs.

Server side logic separates the registered user both from the demographic information provided as well as the daily reflection data submitted by substituting the provided phone number with a member ID.  This is intended to allow Recovree administrators to export the data collected via CSV and provide the information to health professionals interested in sharing the application with test groups.  The long term goal of the application is to secure investors to be able to improve and expand the application for widespread use.

To start up the application:
* Run `npm install`
* Run `grunt' in an open tab of terminal
